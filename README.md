# Israf app

My project is a web application that allows restaurants to distribute food, and users can use the application to see where the restaurants are located on the map and come to pick up the food.

Restaurants have their own accounts, which have the function of opening and closing the restaurant. Administrators can add, delete, and modify users.

The project was developed using Spring Boot and Spring Security, and in the future, validation will be added and Spring Security will be reworked.

## Future Enhancements
In the future, I plan to add validation to the application to ensure that users enter the correct information. I also plan to rework Spring Security to make it more secure and efficient.
